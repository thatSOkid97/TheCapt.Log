      <h3>Crash Landinq!</h3>
      <p>
      The start of the captains log, the start of what seems to be a endless journey throughout
      the big black airless vaccuum known as space. Travelling from planet to planet in search of what,
      a home? endless amounts of money? or knowledge? whatever it is, it will be fun and incredible. And it
      all starts here this first contact on a icy planet with a big ship cutting into the earth like a knife in a
      birthday cake.

      <h3>A View to Remember!</h3>
      <p>
      Space is beautiful, but incredibly dangerous. From its unforgiving environment to various
      things trying to eat you or kill you, however it does have its moments were it provides
      the goods and in this case the view on this unknown planet, which I did not even bother
      to name, is the goods in question.

      <h3>Outer Space Baby!</h3>
      <p>
        I mean what a view, it took a while, jumping from galaxy to galaxy in my mission to...
        hang om what exactly is my mission? But anyways whatever my mission is I came across this
        galaxy and its star and could not pass up the opportunity to take this picture, it would of
        been criminal if I hadn't taken this picture.
